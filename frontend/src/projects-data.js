      'My approach is to announce a very particular fundraise for 1-2 days to buy one thing, for example a military off-road car. Once we did it, I publish a report about a purchase and start a new fundraising. For me, it’s very crucial in terms of fundraising to know soldiers in person or if my friends know them, so we can help real particular people. Secondly, I must be sure that what we bought is really in place and doing its work (shooting, flying etc), and not is being resold on a secondary market. Over 400,000 dollars have been collected in 80 days. ',
